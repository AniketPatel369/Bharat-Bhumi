You are an expert full-stack developer.  
Build me a **web-based Monopoly-style multiplayer game** called **Vyapaar** with the following features:

1. **General**
   - The game is inspired by Monopoly rules (turn-based, property buying, rent, chance/community chest, etc.).
   - Maximum 8 players per room.
   - Real-time communication using **Socket.IO**.
   - Use **JavaScript** (not TypeScript).
   - Backend: **Node.js + Express + Socket.IO**.
   - Frontend: **React.js** with good UI/UX.
   - No paid third-party services. It must run on my own server without costing money.

2. **Room System**
   - Landing page: Shows "Create Room" and "Join Room" options.
   - **Create Room**:
       - Ask for player name.
       - Generate unique Player ID by combining player name + current date-time (dd-MM-yyyyhhmmss).
       - Create a room code (6 random alphanumeric characters).
       - Set room capacity to **8 players** max.
       - Make the player who creates the room the **host**.
   - **Join Room**:
       - Ask for player name.
       - Ask for room code.
       - Check if room exists and has space before joining.
   - Show a lobby screen with the list of connected players and their ready status.
   - Host can start the game when all are ready.

3. **Game Board UI**
   - Draw a Monopoly-style board (SVG or HTML/CSS grid).
   - Each property space should have:
       - Name
       - Price
       - Owner indicator
   - Player tokens (different colors or icons) that move around the board according to dice rolls.
   - Dice roll animation.
   - Interactive UI for buying properties, paying rent, chance cards, etc.

4. **Real-Time Gameplay**
   - Turn-based system synced for all players.
   - Host decides turn order at game start.
   - Socket.IO events for:
       - playerJoined
       - playerLeft
       - gameStarted
       - diceRolled
       - playerMoved
       - propertyBought
       - rentPaid
   - Keep game state on the server so no one can cheat by editing client-side code.

5. **UI/UX**
   - Responsive design so it works on mobile & desktop.
   - Show player avatars, money balance, and properties owned.
   - Smooth animations for token movement, dice rolls, and property transactions.
   - Show in-game chat for players to talk.

6. **Code Structure**
   - `/server` → Node.js + Express + Socket.IO code.
   - `/client` → React.js app.
   - `server.js` runs the backend on port 3001.
   - React app runs on port 3000 and connects to Socket.IO server.

7. **Extra**
   - Use only open-source assets or your own drawings.
   - Prepare the code so I can later deploy it to my own VPS without Firebase.
   - Add comments in the code so I can understand what each part does.

Generate the **full project code** with backend + frontend in one workspace so I can download and run it locally.
